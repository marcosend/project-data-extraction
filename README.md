# project-data-extraction

This project will show how to use a Magic The Gathering API (https://docs.magicthegathering.io/#api_v1sets_list) and download all of the cards into a dataframe. MTG is a tabletop and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield. Released in 1993 by Wizards of the Coast (now a subsidiary of Hasbro), Magic was the first trading card game and had approximately thirty-five million players as of December 2018, and over twenty billion Magic cards were produced in the period from 2008 to 2016, during which time it grew in popularity.
